    <h3>Description</h3>
    <p> Korean bibimbap, along with kimchi, takes its place among the favored foods in Korean cuisine. Meaning mixed rice, bibimbap is a popular meal consisting of white rice topped with vegetables, beef, a whole egg, and gochujang (red chili pepper paste). You can substitute with soy sauce or Sriracha (rooster sauce) for those who cannot handle the spiciness, like our children.

        <ul> 2 teaspoons gochujang (Korean hot pepper paste), divided (Optional) </ul>
    </li>
    <h3>Steps</h3>
    <li>
        <ol>Stir together cucumber pieces and gochujang paste in a bowl; set aside.
        </ol>
        <ol>Bring about 2 cups water to a boil in a large nonstick skillet and stir in spinach; cook until bright green and wilted, 2 to 3 minutes. Drain spinach and squeeze out as much moisture as possible; set spinach aside in a bowl and stir in soy sauce..
        </ol>
        <ol>Heat 1 teaspoon olive oil in a large nonstick skillet; cook and stir carrots until softened, about 3 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook just until fragrant, about 1 minute. Stir in cucumber mixture; sprinkle with red pepper flakes. Set mixture aside in a bowl.
        </ol>
        <ol>Brown beef in a clean nonstick skillet over medium heat, about 5 minutes per side; set aside.
        </ol>
        <ol>Heat remaining 1 teaspoon olive oil in another nonstick skillet over medium-low heat. Fry eggs just on one side until yolks are runny, but whites are firm, 2 to 4 minutes.
        </ol>
        <ol>Divide cooked rice into 4 large serving bowls; top with spinach mixture, a few pieces of beef, and cucumber mixture. Place 1 egg atop each serving. Drizzle each bowl with 1 teaspoon sesame oil, a sprinkle of sesame seeds, and a small amount of gochujang paste if desired.
        </ol>
    </li>
    <h3>Enjoy!</h3>
